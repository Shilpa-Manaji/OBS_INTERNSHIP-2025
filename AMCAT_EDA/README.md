# 📘Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📊 Overview

Welcome to the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** repository! This notebook (`EDA.ipynb`) is designed to help you explore and understand your dataset, uncover hidden patterns, and prepare it for further analysis or machine learning models.

EDA is an essential step in the data science pipeline that helps in:

- Understanding data distributions and key characteristics.
- Identifying missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Exploring relationships between variables.
- Validating assumptions before applying machine learning models.

By leveraging various statistical techniques and visualization tools, EDA ensures that the dataset is clean, structured, and ready for further processing.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Directory Structure**

   Your project should have the following structure:

   ```
   OBS_INTERNSHIP-2025/
   ├── AMCAT_EDA/
   │   ├──Raw_data/
   │   │   └──data.xlsx - Sheet1.csv
   │   ├── EDA.ipynb
   │   ├── README.md
   ```

4. **open the Jupyterbook**

   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   - This will open Jupyter Notebook in your browser.
   - Navigate to the notebooks/ folder and open the EDA.ipynb file.
   - This will open Jupyter Notebook in your browser.

5. **Run the Code Cells**

   - Execute each cell sequentially to complete the task.
